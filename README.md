### Alacritty installation

This is my Alacritty configuration, clone the repo to e.g. `$HOME/.config/` under directory name `alacritty`. 

The `alacritty.yml` file consists of Alacritty configuration. It uses the [JetBrains Mono font](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), so after cloning make sure you have the font installed. The following commands download and unzip the font family to current user's font directory.

```shell
$ cd ~/.local/share/fonts
$ wget https://download.jetbrains.com/fonts/JetBrainsMono-2.304.zip 
$ unzip JetBrainsMono-2.304.zip
$ rm JetBrainsMono-2.304.zip
```
